PACER_WATCHAPP README
=====================

Pacer is a simple Pebble watch app designed to help you pace yourself on a run.
You tell it the run distance and target time, then once you start it it records the distance covered and time and displays the current pace and average pace, with an indicator of whether you are on target to achieve the desired time or not.


Functions
Top right button = start/stop
Bottom right button = reset (if stopped).
Middle right button = settings (if stopped).

Settings allows you to select the race distance and the desired time.
